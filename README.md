It tries to mimic the functionality of an "Etch-a-Sketch Sketchpad".
This project demonstrates my DOM manipulation skills.

#### Thanks to
Thanks @JaxonSong for your library https://github.com/JaxonSong/color-converter to convert RGB color representation to HSL which was useful to increase the brightnes in a easier way.

Also thanks to David Mihal for his code on a Stack Overflow post showing how to generate randomRgb colors which was useful for random color generation in my webpage.
